        <h2 style="font-family: cursive;">Life Updates</h2>
        <p>On a vacation from college (end of semester break), visiting my parents. I had so many plans before I got home, like giving time to drawing, learning new things, reading books... but all I ended up doing was play Valorant all day and sleep. I have 4-5 days left before I go back to the college, and want to make the most out of it.</p>
        <p>For this year, I've planned to make more memories as I realised that I don't really have memories to hold on to for the past, like, 2 years. I want to capture moments in photographs, even if they're nothing significant, I want to capture them. I'll also start working out and get in shape finally, and will try to get in a shape to be able to cosplay Eren Yeager on Halloween 2024. Also, I want to get back to drawing more, start a new Art Account on Instagram, start a Storytime-Animation based YouTube channel.</p><hr>
